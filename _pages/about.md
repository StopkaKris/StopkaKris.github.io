Welcome! My name is Krzysztof (Kris) Stopka, and I am a Research Engineer and Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I work with [Dr. Michael D. Sangid](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=73161) in the [Advanced Computational Materials and Experimental Evaluation (ACME) Laboratory](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~msangid/) and the [Hypersonics Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center](https://research.purdue.edu/hamtc/). I am also one of the developers of [PRISMS-Fatigue](https://github.com/prisms-center/Fatigue), an open-source fatigue analysis tool for polycrystalline metals and alloys.

I am interested in the interface between advanced manufacturing, materials science, crystal plasticity, computational mechanics, fatigue and fracture, and high-energy x-ray diffraction microscopy. I defended my PhD dissertation entitled [Integrated Computational Materials Engineering Workflows for Microstructure-sensitive Fatigue of Advanced Alloys](http://hdl.handle.net/1853/64725) in March 2021 under the advisement of [Dr. David L. McDowell](http://me.gatech.edu/faculty/mcdowell) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). A strong passion of mine outside of research is mentorship, especially for younger students just getting started in their college/academic careers. My long-term goal is to pursue a career in academia.
