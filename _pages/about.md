Welcome! My name is Krzysztof (Kris) Stopka and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I work with [Dr. Michael D. Sangid](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=73161) in the [Advanced Computational Materials and Experimental Evaluation (ACME) Laboratory](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~msangid/). I am also one of the developers of [PRISMS-Fatigue](https://github.com/prisms-center/Fatigue), an open-source fatigue analysis tool for polycrystalline metals and alloys.

I am interested in the interface between materials science, crystal plasticity, computational mechanics, fatigue and fracture, high-energy x-ray diffraction microscopy, and data science and analytics workflows. I successfully defended my PhD dissertation entitled "Integrated Computational Materials Engineering Workflows for Microstructure-Sensitive Fatigue of Advanced Alloys" in March 2021 under the advisement of [Dr. David L. McDowell](http://me.gatech.edu/faculty/mcdowell) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). A strong passion of mine outside of research is mentorship, especially for younger students just getting started in their college/academic careers. My long-term goal is to pursue a career in academia.
